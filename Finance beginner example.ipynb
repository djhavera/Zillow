    "First, let's define some of the basics by giving an overview of financial statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Income Statement: The income statement is a summary of a business's performance over a period of time.  An income statement contains revenue and expenses.  It ultimately answers the question did the company make money over the specified time period.  You can think of an income statement similiar to your checking account.  For example, over the last 3 months was your income higher than your expenses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance Sheet: A balance sheet is a snapshot in time of a company's health at a given point in time that seperates out assets from liabilities.  An asset is anything of value such as a piece of property or a piece of machineary.  In personal finance, an asset would be anything you own outright such as a car or any investments that you may have such as 401k retirement savings.  A liability is a debt that is owed by the company to another party.  In personal finance, a liability would be short term credit card debt or a mortgage.  The balance sheet also illustrates how a company finances its operations with debt or equity.  We will discuss capital structure in another session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash Flow Statement: The cash flow statement illustrates how changes in the income statement and balance sheet affect cash flow.  This is a critical statement to understand because the most common reason that companies go bankrupt is due to lack of cash flow.  The cash flow statement categorizes cash into operating, investing, and financing activities.  As a general rule of thumb, business's aim to have operating profit (income) be converted to cash on a 1 to 1 basis.  We can dig more into this later.  In personal finance, you can analyze your cash flow to see how much money you are able to invest after your everyday expenses are deducted from your income.  The higher the better.\n",

    "Ok, now that we have a basic understanding of how a company organizes it's finances, let's jump into how companies are valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dividend discount model is a great place to start when calculating company value because it illustrates the basic principles of company valuation.  This model assumes that \"A share of a company is worth the present value of all the cash flows an investor expects to pocket from it.\" (1)  In a very simplistic world, this is similiar to how a bond is valued.  An investor buys a bond for an expected yield (i.e. 3%) and the bond price is determined according to this yield.  In terms of stocks, a dividend is similiar to a bond yield because it is the cash that an investor receives from the investment.    In the simplest form a company is worth it's dividend (D) divided by a required return on equity (R), which we will discuss more in depth later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value = D / R\n",
    "\n",
    "The dividend discount is pretty simple.  However, in the real world it is probably not very accurate because the underlying principle,(ie bond and stock investment) can change and the investor isn't guaranteed to receive their orginal investment back.  Either way, the fundamentals of the dividend discount model hold true throughout all company valuation models.  In other words, a company's value is based off of future cash flows given to investors.  As we will see with the next company valuation model the art of company valuation is replacing the dividend with a better estimate of cash flows that the investor can expect.\n"

    "Now let's move onto the most popular discounted cash flow company valuation method: the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC).  The WACC model estimates a company's cash flow and then uses a discount rate to determine the company's intrinsic value.  As we build this model, we will further explore the financial statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The WACC model can be described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "V = D + E\n",
    "\n",
    "Where V is the company value, D is the value of the companies debt and E is the value of the companies equity.  A company's balance sheet is based on a formula where assets = debts to equity.  Debts and equity are instruments that a company uses to finance it's operations.  For example, if a company issues stock for $100 and borrows debt of $200, then it receives cash (an asset) for $300.  In this case, the assets of $300 equal the liabilities of $200 plus the equity of $100.  Therefore, the WACC model just states that the company is worth $300 or the value it has received from financing instruments of stocks and bonds.\n",
    "Nothing is ever free, so the company must pay the bondholder and stockholders a return for their $300 invesment.  This return is called the cost of capital or in laymen terms, the cost for raising money to run a business.\n",

    "RWACC = (1–tc)·xD·RD + xE ·RE\n",

    "I'm not an expert, but here is my best hypothesis. On Microsoft's (and most other company's) cash flow statements, they use the so-called \"indirect method\" of accounting for cash flow from operations. How that works, is they start with net income at the top, and then adjust it with line items for the various non-cash activities that contributed to net income. The key phrase is that these are accounting for the non-cash activities that contribute to net income. If the accounts receivable amount changes from something other than operating activity (e.g., if they have to write off some receivables because they won't be paid), the change didn't contribute to net income in the first place, so doesn't need to be reconciled on the cash flow statement."
